# Hello and welcome ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Recent graduate of Le Wagon, looking for my first job as a developer

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on Rails as my first framework, with
    2 Web Apps pushed to production (plenty more to come)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m hoping to collaborate on further projects to build my skillset.
    Front or Backend, i'm happy with both!
